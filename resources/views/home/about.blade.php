        <ul>
          <li>freelance</li>
          <li>self-taught</li>
          <li>passionate</li>
          <li>experienced</li>
        </ul> <mark>full stack webdeveloper</mark>.</p>
      <p>When I was a kid and I first met with the net, I was quite amazed about the
      stuffs I saw. That was the point where I decided that I <mark>WANT</mark> to understand it,
      and I want to create things like that.</p>

      <p>A few years later, as I started to learn web dev basics
        (<mark>HTML</mark> and <mark>CSS</mark>), my appetite grown in the same pace
        and I became curious about the MAGIC (<mark>JS</mark>), which could brings a website
        alive.
      </p>

      <p>It took a while to realised that my hobby's name was <mark>front end development</mark>.</p>

      <p>As time went on, my curiosity doesn't decreased, and I started to focus on a smaller part of the
      web - the informations themselfs. I wanted to know, how to get or store informations, and I wanted to
      learn how to manage them, so I spashed into the ocean of servers (<mark>PHP</mark>) and databases
      (<mark>MySQL</mark>), and also take a while to realise, that I'm on the <mark>back end</mark> side of
      the <mark>development</mark>.</p>

      <p>As I turned into the back end, my passion about front end reached a new level, and if I should have to
        choose between the two parts, I would be in huge trouble.</p>

      <p>And now, looking back to the path that lead me here, I can say I'm the same kid I was once, with the same curiosity
        in my eyes I had once, and I have less confident about my knowledge as I see the endless horizont of this
        amazin trip.</p>

      <p>So that's the reason, I think of myself as a <mark>full stack web developer</mark>.</p>
