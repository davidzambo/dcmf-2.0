      <p>When I was a kid and I first met with the net, I was quite amazed about the
      stuffs I saw. That was the point where I decided that I WANT to understand it,
      and I want to create things like that.</p>

      <p>A few years later, as I started to learn web dev basics
        (<mark>HTML</mark> and <mark>CSS</mark>), my appetite grown in the same pace
        and I became curious about the MAGIC (<mark>JS</mark>), which could brings a website
        alive.
      </p>

      <p>It took a while to realised that my hobby's name was <mark>frontend development</mark>.</p>

      <p>As time went on, my curiosity doesn't decreased, and I started to focus on a smaller part of the
      web - the informations themselfs. I wanted to know, how to get or store informations, and I wanted to
      learn how to manage them, so I spashed into the ocean of servers (<mark>PHP</mark>) and databases
      (<mark>MySQL</mark>), and also take a while to realise, that I'm on the <mark>backend</mark> side of
      the <mark>development</mark></p>
