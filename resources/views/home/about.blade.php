        <p>When I was a kid and I first met with the net, I was quite amazed about the
        stuffs I saw. That was the point where I decided that I <mark>WANT</mark> to understand it,
        and I want to create things like that.</p>

        <p>A few years later, as I started to learn web dev basics
          (<mark>HTML</mark> and <mark>CSS</mark>), my appetite grown in the same pace
          and I became curious about the MAGIC (<mark>JS</mark>), which could brings a website
          alive.
        </p>

        <p>It took a while to realise that my hobby's name was <mark>front end development</mark>.</p>

        <p>As time went on, my curiosity doesn't decreased, and I put my focus on another part of the
        web - the informations themselfs. I wanted to know, how to get or store informations, and I wanted to
        learn how to manage them, so I spashed into the ocean of servers (<mark>PHP</mark>) and databases
        (<mark>MySQL</mark>), and also take a while to realise, that I'm on the <mark>back end</mark> side of
        the <mark>development</mark>.</p>

        <p>As I turned into the back end, my passion about front end reached a new level, and if I should have to
          choose between the two parts, I would be in huge trouble.</p>

        <p>So that's the reason, I think of myself as a <mark>full stack web developer</mark>.</p>
